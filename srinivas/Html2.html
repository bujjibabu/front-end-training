	<p>India is a vast South Asian                      country with diverse terrain – from Himalayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline – and history reaching back 5 millennia. In the north,                  Mughal Empire landmarks include Delhi’s Red Fort complex, massive Jama Masjid mosque and Agra’s iconic Taj Mahal mausoleum. Pilgrims bath                           e in the Ganges in Varanasi, and Rishikesh is a yoga center and base for Himalayan trekking.
